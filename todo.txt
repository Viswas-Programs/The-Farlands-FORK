Silver:
- Item and Block models, Hand model
- Multiplayer Building/Breaking
- Better inventory layout 
(crafting should just be a smaller window next to the backpack)
- Attack/Break/Build player animations
- Optimise server
- Proper lighting for box meshes 
(i'll make a second shader program for them)
- Animating blocks 
(This can all be done in a vertex/fragment shader by messing around with uvs)
- Fix delta issues with friction

-> Optimise Server:
- Only send messages once a second for each player
(then use message buffers, this will greatly reduce bandwidth usage, due to the 58 byte per message thing)
- Only send nearby players
- Move player data into single array (saves like 10 bytes per message)

-> Optimise Game:
- Capping fps
- LOD
- Occlusion Culling
- Better Frustum Culling

Overscore:
- create ore vein generation
- make different biomes (more tree types, different grasses)
